  notes:
  - |-
    Do not use this method with example groups that have side effects,
    e.g. define a memoized `#let` helper or a `#before` block that is
    intended to modify the behavior of sibling examples. Wrapping the
    example group in a `describe` block breaks that relationship. Best
    practice is to use the `#wrap_examples` method to safely encapsulate
    example groups with side effects, and the `#xwrap_examples` method to
    automatically skip such groups.
params:
- description: The name of the shared example group to be wrapped.

    Optional array of arguments that are passed on to
    the shared example group.

    Optional hash of keyword arguments that are passed
    on to the shared example group.
  name: kwargs

short_description: |-
  Includes the specified shared example group and wraps it inside an
  `xdescribe` block named "(skipped)". This will ensure that the wrapped
  example group is not run.
yields:
- description: Optional block that is passed on to the shared example group.
