      The name of contract to include.
      The contract must be defined as a Class or constant in the same scope,
      e.g. include_contract('does something') expects the example group to
      define either a DoSomething class or a DO_SOMETHING constant. The name
      can optionally be suffixed with "contract", so it will also match a
      DoSomethingContract class or a DO_SOMETHING_CONTRACT constant.
