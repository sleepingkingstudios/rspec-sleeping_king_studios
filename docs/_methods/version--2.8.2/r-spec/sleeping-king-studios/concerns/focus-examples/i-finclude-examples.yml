    Do not use this method with example groups that have side effects,
    e.g. define a memoized `#let` helper or a `#before` block that is
    intended to modify the behavior of sibling examples. Wrapping the
    example group in a `describe` block breaks that relationship. Best
    practice is to use the `#wrap_examples` method to safely encapsulate
    example groups with side effects, and the `#fwrap_examples` method to
    automatically focus such groups.

  Includes the specified shared example group and wraps it inside an
  `fdescribe` block named "(focused)". If the spec runner is set to run only
  focused specs, this will ensure that the wrapped example group is run.
