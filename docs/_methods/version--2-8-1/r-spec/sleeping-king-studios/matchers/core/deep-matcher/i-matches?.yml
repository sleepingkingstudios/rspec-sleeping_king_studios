description: |-
  - If the expected object is an RSpec matcher, the #matches? method on the
    matcher is called with the expected object.
  - If the expected object is an Array, then each item is compared based on
    the type of the expected item.
  - If the expected object is a Hash, then the keys must match and each
    value is compared based on the type of the expected value.
  - Otherwise, the two objects are compared using an equality comparison.
