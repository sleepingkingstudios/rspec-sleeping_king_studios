description: |-
  This prevents an insidious bug when using the do..end block syntax to
  create a block expectation while the matcher macro is itself an argument
  to another function, such as ExpectationTarget#to. This bug causes the
  block to be silently ignored and any enumerable object to match against
  the matcher, even an empty object.

  deprecated: "[3.0] Will be removed in version 3.0."
returns:

    True if the empty include matchers are permitted,
    otherwise false.
  type:
  - name: Boolean
short_description: |-
  Sets whether the #include matcher can be instantiated without an
  expectation object or block. If this option is set to false, an
  ArgumentError will be raised when attempting to instantiate an
  IncludeMatcher without any expectations.
